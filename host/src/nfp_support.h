 * @brief         NFP support library
 *
 * This library abstracts some of the Netronome NFP library calls to
 * make host applications a little simpler.
 *
 * For example, the NFP device opening and closing is wrapped in the
 * library, adding atexit handlers and so on, so that firmware and
 * NFPs are handled cleanly.
