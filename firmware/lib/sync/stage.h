 * @brief         Staged initialization sycnrhonization library
 *
 * This is a library of functions used by application firmware to
 * provide a standard way to order threads and islands
 *
 * The macro SYNC_STAGE_SET_PREINIT should be used in the C source
 * every ME that is to be synchronized. This should be invoked with
 * the number of stages that are used (in the application), the number
 * of contexts used in the microengine, the number of microengines
 * used in the island, and the number of islands used in the
 * application
 *
 * It is then expected that every context in the microengine will
 * eventually invoke sync_stage_set_stage_complete(NUM_STAGES) to
 * indicate that it has completed initialization.
 *
 * Prior to invoking sync_stage_set_stage_complete with NUM_STAGES,
 * the thread may invoke it with a smaller number (still greater than
 * 0). This will permit all threads in the application that wait for
 * that value to synchronize, permitting initialization to occur in
 * stages.
 *
 * For example, threads may set up queues in a first stage, then wait
 * for host interaction to start in a second stage, then enter the
 * main execution phase and invoke the final main application thread
 * code.
 *
 * A thread which only host interaction to start and a main thread may
 * call sync_stage_set_stage_complete(QUEUE_STAGE), then run its host
 * interaction, then issue sync_stage_set_stage_complete(ALL_INIT).
 *
 * A thread which has queues to initialize and no host interaction may
 * perform its queue initialization then just issue
 * sync_stage_set_stage_complete(ALL_INIT).
